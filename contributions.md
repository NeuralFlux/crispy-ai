# Contributions

Your contributions are always welcome!

Contribution Best Practices:
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged.
- When you make very minor changes to a PR of yours make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix.
