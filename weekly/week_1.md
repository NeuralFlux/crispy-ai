# Week 1 : Building a Basic Django App

We shall start by making a Users app for every user to access courses and get basic info about them. 
We shall then move on to make an Admin app to add courses and manage users. 

Here's what we will be trying to implement in ***Week 1*** -

`Users` App

- Implementing a Login-Authentication system in the Users App.
- Creating a Home View for users
- Creating a Base template with a navbar and footer.[Using Bootstrap]
- Creating a View to register users with email verification.
- Create a View for resetting User password
- Creating a Profile model for each user
- Create a View to see and edit Users Profile

`Admin` App

- Create a Course Model
- Create a Home View for admin and list all courses in it.
- Create a View to register new courses

Back to `Users` App

- Display all courses available in the home view
- Create a View to display all details for a particular course (when clicked on from Home View)
